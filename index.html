		<h1>Oh the Things You Learn!</h1>
		    <h2>Date: June 30th</h2>
		    <p>I learned how to use tags in html. I think that this will be harder to do when incorporating more elements into html like CSS and Javascript, but I will cross that path when I come to it. There is still so much to learn! It's a little overwhelming but I have to take just one step at a time, at "baby" speed, haha!</p>
		    <h3>Update: Date: July 1st</h3>
		   <p>I have also learned that html pages have a head and a body. Content like the information about your webpage and components are going to be in it go inside the head. The body holds all the content posted on your website, like pictures, gifs, videos and music. It is really fun to see all the inner workings of something that you use and see everyday. Even though mine is basic, I feel in control of the internet somehow, like I can create soomething useable that people can access and learn from, kind of like in a classroom.</p>
		   <h4>Teacher Corner!</h4>
		   <p>I bet this would be a really good tool for teachers to use in their classrooms, or with anyone wanting to put something out ther in the world for people to see; either to create a movement or make a statement, or to sell an invention to help others.</p>
		    <p><h5>Oh I have so much more to learn!</h5></p>

	   <h4>Gamer Corner!</h4> 
	   <p>Just played counter stirke:global offensive and it was awesome!! I was oing pretty good, and I just got a new deagle, such beautiful gold art on it :)</p>
	   <p>I have now learned about the 6 different size headings you can use in html. <h2>GO ME! I'M DOING IT!'</h2></p>
<h6>I am struggling with making all the text a same heading size. I also don't understand why if you wrap the whole body in a heading tag that it won't recognize it and change the entire text to something bigger. I still want to mess around with it a little bit to understand what i can and can't do. Wish me Luck!</h6>

    <h2>Just Random Posts!</h2>
    <p>I really like the color purple</p>
    <p>I went to the park and played volleyball; something i haven't done in forever! It was a lot of fun becuase we all goofed off during the matches, and we even had some smooth live music to listen from a party in the pavillion next to us. Cool Stuff!
    </p>
    <p>July 7th: I Really want to see how my emotional intellignec stands up this week. I had a couple mishaps last week and I don't not want to make the same mistakes I made before. I really feel bad, and I know the situations all left their mark, even though I didn't want them to. It makes me sad, but I will just have to get over it and move on. I also feel frustrated with myself. But regardless of how i feel, I need to think before I act. It is harder than it looks, and it is also hard to remember in every situation.</p>
		<h1>ohhh yeahhh gettin it!</h1>
	<p>My name is Krystyn and welcome to my first webpage! I am a graduate and am teaching myself how to code. Pretty simple, right? Well not exactly. right now I only know bare minimum of what I will be trying to work with in the near future!! I hope to become fluent in html and other languages, but I have to take baby steps! right now the stuff I'm learning is pretty basic, but I am retaining knowledge of it all so that I will be able to code from scratch! Right now I am struggling with terminology and using images and links. I just can't remember how to put links into text and images. '</p>

	<p> books books books! currently i am reading the Harry Potter series, specifically Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azgaban. these books are quite good, i think becuase J.K. Rowling took her time to describe scenery around the characters, and to describe the inner feelings and thoughts carefully for each character, making them come to life! I have to say I am dissappointed in the way the movies were made because they left out so many hilairious and magical aspects of the inner workings of Hogwarts and some the supporting characters that dwell in the school, like Peeves the Poltergiest! THAT TROUBLE MAKER WOULD HAVE MADE THE MOVIES SO GREAT! Not that the movies weren't done well, I just think they need more childlike feelings involved.' </p>
	<p>My Goals for this Week: Tackle creating a full webpage with CSS and style elements, and to contiunue my work on ruby.</p>
<p>About Me: I used to be really into music. I played 5 instruments and I used to sing in every school performance and at sporting events. Anything I could sing and/or dance in. I also and a fan of video games. I read game informer freqeuntly and I have experienced a large number of video games! I haven't always played them, but all through college I played quite a bit! My favorite game so far is Counter Strike: Global Offensive, I can't get off of it! If you are a player, I personally am pretty good at the SG, so BEWARE.I also love clothes! I think you say a lot with your style, and I like changing mine a lot. I don't, however, like they way my wallet changes as well, but that comes with the territory I think. I really like finding something new in patterns, and where the clothes are made. I like to think about these things haha.'</p>
<p>I really love Doctor Who. For those of you whom ask 'Who is Doctor Who?', I Tell you, <a href=http://eleventhtenth.deviantart.com/art/Doctor-Who-All-Thirteen-430321958>This is him.</a> He always changes and always saves the day. The pictures in the page are the writings of Gallifreyan, the time lords' ways of writen language. I reccommend that you all enlighten yourselfs to this wonderful show.</p>
